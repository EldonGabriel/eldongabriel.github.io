My cybersecurity journey began with a mindset: don’t just collect theory—build skills that work in the real world.
That’s exactly what I found when I enrolled in the **MICS – Introduction to Cyber Security** course through Mossé Cyber Security Institute. After completing **_39 practical exercises_**, I’ve officially earned:

These certificates are more than titles—they’re earned through real labs, real tools, and real problem-solving. The MICS course helped me build foundational skills across multiple domains of cybersecurity and gave me the confidence to move into more advanced operations and system-level thinking.

## What I Gained from MICS

The MICS experience was **100% hands-on**. There were no pre-written answers—only guided learning through testing, research, and trial-and-error. This approach helped me develop real-world fluency in key areas like:

### 🔹 OSINT & Reconnaissance
- Created covert accounts and mindmaps from social media data  
- Used `dnsdumpster.com`, Shodan, and `dnstwist.py` to detect asset exposure and phishing campaigns  

### 🔹 Vulnerability & Penetration Testing
- Performed **TCP/UDP** scans using **Nmap**  
- Ran web app scans using **Burp Suite Spider** and **Intruder**  
- Used **OpenVAS** to identify vulnerabilities in a virtual environment  

### 🔹 Threat Hunting & Malware Detection
- Built **custom YARA rules** for identifying binaries and strings  
- Documented and tested rules to match professional standards  

### 🔹 Digital Forensics
- Used **Dumpzilla** to analyze browser artifacts  
- Performed static malware analysis using **PEStudio** 

These exercises were supported by a focus on **professional writing and technical research**, sharpening both my technical and communication skills—critical for any analyst or engineer in the field.

## Why I Chose to Enroll in MSAF

After earning my Level 3 certification and completing the MICS course, I knew it was time to dive deeper. That’s why I enrolled in **MSAF – System Administration Fundamentals**, a course designed to build mastery in the systems that power and secure enterprise environments.

📄 I’ve attached my official **Confirmation of Enrolment** from Mossé Cyber Security Institute, verifying that I’m actively enrolled and progressing through the course.

## What MSAF Will Help Me Master

The MSAF course goes beyond concepts—it teaches how to **build, secure, and recover real systems**. Here’s a preview of what I’m working on:

### 💻 Virtualization
- Deploying virtual machines (VMs) in VirtualBox, VMware, GCP, and AWS  
- Creating snapshots and restoring safe system states  
- Installing and configuring VMware ESXi and managing via vSphere  

### 🖥️ Windows & Linux Hardening
- Creating and deploying GPOs to enforce password policies, exploit protection, UAC, and patch management  
- Locking down user rights, folders, and remote access  
- Securing _Windows Defender_ and configuring SMB and WinRM  

### 🔐 Network Security & Firewalls
- Designing network architectures in Draw.io and Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Creating and testing firewall rules with pfSense  
- Secure VPN tunneling and traffic filtering  

### 💾 Backup & Recovery
- Using Duplicati and Windows tools to build backup and restoration workflows  
- Backing up and restoring Active Directory  
- Simulating server migrations from on-prem to cloud  

All of this work contributes to my **public portfolio**, showcasing not just theory—but evidence of capability.

## Why This Matters

The cyber workforce doesn’t need more paper certs—it needs people who can **solve problems under pressure**.
By completing MICS and enrolling in MSAF, I’m reinforcing a **portfolio-first mindset** backed by tools, techniques, and repeatable results. 

From YARA rules to GPO enforcement, every step I take is documented and demonstrated for employers, collaborators, and mentors to see.
Whether I’m threat hunting, writing policy, or hardening a Windows server, my goal is the same: **deliver real, tested value**.

## Final Thoughts

MCSI’s approach to cybersecurity training is unlike anything I’ve experienced. With every lab and report, I’m building the skills that matter in the field.
