As I continue exploring the cybersecurity field, one thing has become clear: hands-on experience is essential. While online learning and certifications build knowledge, breaking into this competitive industry requires practical, lived experience.

When I searched for entry-level cybersecurity internships, I found most required years of prior experience or a degree—discouraging for newcomers. That’s when I discovered the **Mossé Cyber Security Institute (MCSI)** and thier **MSAF – System Administration Fundamentals** course. Their no-solutions approach, research-based exercises, and individualized feedback stood out immediately.

Even more, MCSI provides **_100 hours of free training_** with their **(MICS) - Introduction to Cyber Security training**. This is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice. I enrolled to see if it could provide the real-world experience I had been missing.

## Why MCSI Stands Out

MCSI’s training feels like a true apprenticeship. Even within my first lessons, I received custom cybersecurity report templates and constructive feedback from tutors on each submission. This approach not only builds technical knowledge but also improves essential skills like written communication.

Unlike traditional courses, MCSI challenges me with real-world cybersecurity problems while providing personalized feedback to help me improve. Their focus on hands-on training and measurable outcomes makes it clear where my strengths are and where I need more practice.

## Improving My Technical Writing Skills

An unexpected benefit of this training has been the improvement of my technical writing. In cybersecurity, documentation is just as critical as technical ability. Clear communication of risks, findings, and processes ensures security decisions can be acted upon.

Through MCSI, I’m practicing structured reporting and professional communication. Writing blogs like this one reinforces my understanding, while also developing habits that will serve me in security operations, compliance, and investigations.

## Why Hands-On Experience Matters

Certifications and online courses are important for understanding concepts, but employers want proof of applied skills. That’s where MCSI shines—giving students opportunities to practice, document, and showcase cybersecurity tasks in real-world scenarios.

The 100 hours of free training provides a foundation to demonstrate my skills through a growing cybersecurity portfolio. This hands-on work becomes the evidence that I can perform in real operational environments.

📄 I’ve attached my official Confirmation of Enrolment from Mossé Cyber Security Institute, verifying that I’m actively enrolled and progressing through the course.

## Next Steps

After completing the coursework, I plan to:

- Upgrade my portfolio with new skills, certifications, and reports from _MSAF – System Administration Fundamentals_ course.
